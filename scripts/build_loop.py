"""
GST Filing App — 3-Agent Autonomous Build Loop.

Roles (all via `hermes chat --oneshot` subprocesses):
  BUILDER  — writes code, follows docs
  TESTER   — runs the verification itself, emits PASS/FAIL with real evidence
  MONITOR  — SUPERVISES: inspects the Tester's evidence, inspects the Builder's
             output, then either ADVANCE / RETRY / ESCALATE, and issues a
             concrete BUILDER INSTRUCTION that is fed into the next build
             attempt. The Monitor is not a rubber stamp: it must state whether
             the Tester produced REAL command evidence or only a summary, and
             it must name the exact defect the Builder has to fix.

MODEL ROUTING — every role is a FALLBACK CHAIN, not a single hard-coded id.
Each candidate is liveness-probed once per run (build/role_models.json) and the
first live one wins, so a rate-limited or retired route degrades gracefully
instead of stalling the loop.

A singleton lock (build/loop.lock) prevents duplicate instances racing on
state.json — a second launch exits immediately while a live loop holds it.

The loop runs until all phases in build/plan.json are done, or the monitor
escalates to the human, or MAX_ITERATIONS is hit. Every decision is logged
to build/state.json and build/run.log.

Usage:
    python scripts/build_loop.py [--once] [--max-iters N] [--no-probe]

--once:     run a single cycle (pick next task, build, test, monitor) then exit.
--no-probe: skip liveness probing and use the first candidate of each chain.

# OmniRoute (ollama-cloud credits are exhausted / being reserved). Do not add an

HARD RULES (from docs/AI_BUILD_PLAYBOOK.md):
1. Never fabricate GSTINs/PANs/invoices. Synthetic fixture GSTINs must pass the mod-36 checksum (helper exists in scripts/ or tests/).
2. Money is integer paise everywhere. No float crosses any boundary.
3. Every registration-scoped route goes through the access guard dependency.
4. Locked periods return 423; originals never edited post-filing.
5. ruff + mypy clean (backend); eslint + tsc clean (frontend). Lint failures block.
6. Declare deps in pyproject.toml / package.json — never pip install at runtime.
7. Do NOT touch files outside this task's scope.
8. NEVER modify any file under build/ (plan.json, state.json, run.log, prompt.txt) or scripts/build_loop.py — those are the loop's own control files, not project code. Editing them corrupts the build loop.
9. If a doc is ambiguous, STOP and say so in your final summary — do not guess in the GST domain.
{fb}
FINISH by running the task's verification yourself and reporting exact test names + counts in your final summary. Your final summary is what the Tester will read — be precise.

3. Check the docs-contract: API shapes, paise-not-float, guard dependency, lock rules.
4. Check for foreign edits: git diff --stat should show ONLY files in this task's scope.
5. Verify with REAL command output (test names + pass/fail counts).

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT (a verdict without this is rejected):
- Paste the ACTUAL command lines you ran and their ACTUAL output (test names + counts, or exact error text).
- Name the files you inspected with path:line where relevant.
- If you did not run anything, say so explicitly — never invent output.

OUTPUT FORMAT (exactly this, so the loop can parse it):
COMMANDS RUN:
- <exact command> → <observed result>
VERDICT: PASS  or  VERDICT: FAIL
FINDINGS:
- <concrete finding, with file:line or command output>

ALL PHASES (from build/plan.json) — {len(load_json(PLAN_PATH, {})['phases'])} phases. You are on phase {phase['id']}.
There {'IS' if next_phase else 'is NO'} a next phase{' — ' + next_phase['id'] + ' ' + next_phase['name'] if next_phase else ''}.

YOUR SUPERVISION DUTIES — answer each explicitly:
A. EVIDENCE CHECK: did the Tester actually run commands and show real output, or did it just restate the Builder's claims? Quote the proof or say MISSING.
B. SCOPE CHECK: does the work match this task's scope and the docs contract? Name any drift.
C. CORRECTNESS GAP: name the single most important defect remaining, with file:line if possible. If truly none, say NONE.

Then DECIDE and output EXACTLY this format:

TESTER_EVIDENCE: REAL | WEAK
DEFECT: <one line — the most important remaining defect, or NONE>
BUILDER_INSTRUCTION: <one concrete, imperative instruction the Builder must follow next
                      attempt. Must name files/functions/commands. Write NONE only if you
                      are ADVANCEing with no further work.>
ACTION: ADVANCE   |   ACTION: RETRY   |   ACTION: ESCALATE
NEXT: <task id to do next, or "none">
REASON: <one line why>

RULES:
- ADVANCE only if the tester said PASS AND the evidence is REAL AND you found no blocking defect.
- RETRY if the tester said FAIL, OR the evidence is WEAK (force a real re-verification), OR a fix is clearly actionable. Always supply a BUILDER_INSTRUCTION on RETRY (max {MAX_RETRIES} retries already tracked).
- ESCALATE if: a task failed after retries, docs are ambiguous and you cannot resolve, or all phases are complete. Every ESCALATE MUST carry a REASON — escalation halts the build and waits for a human, so an unexplained one is treated as a formatting error and re-asked.
- When a phase's tasks are all done, set NEXT to the first task of the next phase. If no next phase, ACTION: ESCALATE with NEXT:none and REASON "all phases complete".
- If you ADVANCE, also decompose any stub task whose title contains "expand at runtime" into concrete tasks and write them into build/plan.json BEFORE proceeding (real tasks with id/title/docs/done_when).

OUTPUT LANGUAGE: English ONLY. The field labels TESTER_EVIDENCE / DEFECT /
BUILDER_INSTRUCTION / ACTION / NEXT / REASON must be written exactly as given, in
ASCII English, each on its own line. The loop parses these mechanically — a
translated label (e.g. 操作/原因/证据) is invisible to it and stops the build.
You may quote foreign-language text inside a field's VALUE, never as a label.
