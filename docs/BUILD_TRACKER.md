# GST Filing App — Build Tracker

**Repo:** `github.com/Sudarshan077/gst1` · **Branch:** `main`  
**Stack:** Python 3.11 (FastAPI · SQLAlchemy · Alembic · PostgreSQL) backend · Next.js 16 + TypeScript (App Router · Tailwind · shadcn/ui) frontend  
**Build mode:** 3-agent loop — Builder / Tester / Monitor. Every task is independently verified by the Tester (real command output: pytest, ruff, mypy, tsc, Playwright) before the Monitor may ADVANCE it. Backend and frontend are built together in the same loop.

## Definition of done (per task)

A task counts as Done only when all of these hold:

| Gate | Command | Must be |
|---|---|---|
| Backend tests | `cd backend && ./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/` | all pass |
| Lint | `ruff check .` | clean |
| Types | `mypy .` | clean |
| Frontend types | `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit` | clean |
| Frontend lint | `npm run lint` | clean |
| E2E (where specified) | `npx playwright test` | pass |

Independent Tester re-runs these against the live tree; Monitor ADVANCEs only on `evidence=REAL`.

## How to read this file

This tracker is the single source of truth, generated from the build loop's `plan.json` + `state.json`. It is regenerated and re-committed at every phase boundary. Task-level evidence (tester verdicts, defect reports, commits) lives in the git history and in `GST_BUILD_STATUS.md`.
